# Provider

`provider.Gateway` is the only model execution path. It exposes explicit
`Identity`, `Capabilities`, and `Stream(Request)`. The package owns provider
messages, tool calls/results, stream events, usage, sources, opaque state, and
prepared-request contracts.

Official OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic adapters implement the same Gateway
interface. Credentials, base URLs, and transport clients belong to adapter
construction in the host, never to `config.AgentConfig` or durable state.

A gateway declaring expanded attachment payloads must also implement
`provider.RequestPreparer`. Missing, malformed, or adapter-incompatible
prepared fragments fail explicitly; runtime never reconstructs a second
provider request.

Tests use `florettest.ScriptedGateway`. Production has no fake response field or
provider-name selection branch.

Provider request context has two invariants. The canonical message lineage is
provider-neutral and append-only for one prompt scope and compaction generation.
Rendered system, tool, and message segments use an independent lineage keyed by
provider, model, adapter revision, and cache namespace. Switching models on a
new Turn keeps the complete canonical path without treating the new envelope as
drift. Switching back reuses that model's earlier raw prefix and renders the
intervening canonical messages as a suffix.

Opaque provider state, response IDs, and native continuation metadata never
cross a provider/model change. A smaller target model triggers normal
pre-request compaction only when its own context policy reports pressure.
